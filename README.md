🏆 Brief introduction about a project:

Since tourism is one of the most significant industries in India, we aim to simplify it with our project, helping people to spend a holiday at some 
of the most desirable holiday destinations. With this site, we aim to handle the planning part while families can just focus of the fun part.

We will be using ASP-dotnetframework/html for the front-end and php MyAdmin/C# for the back-end. The styling part will be done using CSS 
while the functionality will be added using C#. 
We plan on making it as user-friendly as possible, with preplanned packages and even custom packages available which user can choose according to his preference.

Along with being one of the biggest industries in India, tourism is also the most profitable one; especially with such exotic natural(SasanGir) 
and historical (Taj Mahal) tourist destinations. Plus, for a family who has been through a stressful time lately, a holiday can be relaxing and enjoyable.

We will provide accommodation, transportation, ratings, photos. 
Places that we will cover in our trip will have historical monuments ,coastal areas etc.

The customer can sign in/sign up and search for the tour packages.
And see about diffrent places of india and know about indian atmosphere.
The design is pretty simple and the user won’t find it difficult to understand, use and navigate.
